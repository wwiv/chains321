         Welcome to CONSPIRACY, the game of gang-warfare. In this imaginary
     world, you are trying to become the most powerful gang. Basically,
     you want to accumulate men, money, and control over organizations.

         But the world is not simple. There are adversaries to be dealt
     with, as well as such minor things like the law. To become a GREAT
     gang leader, you need to not only develop your own gauntlet of
     power, but you also need to keep others in line-- be it by bribery
     or force.

         There are 4 stages in each turn that you need to be concened
     with. The first is your income; this will determine your operating
     budget for you. This is dependent on the total area you control,
     the number of organizations you control, and other factors
     explained fully later. The second stage is the recruiter report.
     You have a recruiter(s) who is always on the lookout for new
     members to your coalition. Your recruiter(s) will gain 'reserves'
     for you in the different types of jobs you might want; anything
     from generic goons to top-the-notch agents. You can actually use
     these men as reserves if you pay your salaries. if you don't,
     then they remain in reserve. The third stage is (of
     course) salaries. You pay off all the members of your gang. The
     final stage is where you actually do something. This is the player
     activity stage.

          There are 5 menus in the player activity stage...

                A)TTACKS:
          This your method of increasing your power, or handling other
          gangs that are out of line.

          A- attack: this will attack all the occupants of an
     individual location, just doing general damage and destruction, as
     well as wiping out whoever happens to be there.

          C- control: this is an attempt to 'take over' an organization. 
     This will make them give you a certain portion of there income to you 
     every day. It will also give you certain 'special abilities' if the 
     organization is important; i.e. controlling the police would let 
     you arrest members of other gangs.

          D- destroy: you don't care about an organization, but don't 
     want anyone else to have it. Bliph! Then, no more organization!

          F- free: there might be an organization under someone else's 
     control. You don't want to take it over, or destroy it, but just 
     don't want them to have it. So Wa-la! If you succeed, then it is no 
     longer under control.

          M- murder: your all purpose deal with an unfriendly person
     command. This is very useful for weakening other gangs. The murder 
     command will attempt to kill one of their 'bosses', limiting their 
     strength.  Or you could attack their recruiters. Or, you can try to 
     kill the "top banana." If you succeed in the latter, or killing all 
     the bossess of a player, then that player's gang crumbles into chaos.


          INTELLIGENCE

          Intelligence is useful for finding out general information. 
     This requires either spies or agents. If successful, you find out 
     info on what you chose to spy on. If unsuccessful, your 
     infiltrators are eradicated...

          A- activate counteragents: this will put your agents on patrol
     to prevent other groups from spying on you. It will also protect 
     both you and your bosses from being assassinated.

          C- check out a location: send a couple of guys to 'examine' a 
     location. This will tell you what is generally there; like enemy 
     gangs, D&S demand, and anything else important.

          I- infiltrate gang: this is an attempt to get an agent inside 
     of another organization. If you succeed, you will find out a lot of 
     info on the target gang before yor agent bails out. If he doesn't 
     succeed, you won't have to pay his salary next turn...     
          
          L- lay low: this will increase the safety of your gang, but 
     you will miss a turn. This should be used if you KNOW someone is 
     out to get you, and they are stronger than you. Or, if the cops are
     real POed at you, it is not a bad idea then either.

          S- search for gangs: this will send your men out in search of 
     other gangs. It will tell you stuff like WHO is out there. Without 
     doing this, you may never find out who you are competing with. If 
     successful, you will find out WHO they are. Be careful-- anyone can 
     attack someone once they know the gang name; so don't tell anyone 
     your gang's name!
     

          MOVE COMMANDS

          A- activate reserves: this will allow you to position anyone 
     on reserves anywhere that you control.

          M- move: move men from one place to another.

          W- withdraw to reserves: take some men back into reserves. 
     They can be kept there, or re-activated with 'A.'

          Note- even when in 'reserve', you still must pay salaries for 
     them.


          PUBLICITY

          Publicity is your attempt to keep everything nice and orderly 
     with the public. Idealistically, the public should never know 
     you exist. Unfortunately, leaders always make mistakes, and the 
     media is always there to tell everyone. If the public becomes to
     aware/frightened of you, the cops will make life for you difficult. 
     If the public is delighted by your presence, you might have trouble 
     keeping discipline among your staff, as well as collecting 
     protection money from organizations you control. The idea is to 
     stay balanced somewhere between the two endpoints. Everything you 
     do affects your public rating, but there are other things you can 
     do also just for impact here.

          C- charity: sacrificing men and $$$ for a good cause. This 
     generally makes the public like you more. Men you contribute to the 
     ministry or other public affairs are permanently gone. 

          N- nark: tell on another gang. Give the cops info on them. 
     This generally hurts their public rating, but does little to yours.

          R- random killing- not something to be commanded by a priest.


          STATUS

          There are ways to figure out what is going on, as well as the 
     general outlook. 

          F- financial: tell you how your $$$ flow is going.

          L- local: give you stats for an area you control

          M- military: how your men are doing. You have different types 
     of personelle involved here, so you will get an indiviual 
     inventory.


          TRADING

          Just giving away stuff to other gangs. I doubt if anyone will 
     ever use it, but it is possible... Pretty self-explanatory.


          Other misc. gook that didn't fit in anywhere...
           
          Combat:
     
          Every combat, there is a winner and a loser. Each side has a 
     strength determined by the number of men and of each type, as well 
     as the amount of $$$ that you pump into them before combat.
          
          Men:

          There are several kinds of useful men you hire...
          Goons- general grunt. Good for combat, but not much else.
          Elite- an intelligent grunt. Better in combat, and needs no 
     leader.
          Leader- leads the grunts. W/O these, your grunts' true 
     intelligence is brought forth, usually not helping the situation. 
     You want to have at least one leader for every 5 attacking grunts.
          Boss- in charge of an operation. You can only make as many 
     attacks as the number of bosses you have. If you have only 1 boss, 
     you may make an attack on one area only once a day.
          Spy- an intelligence agent. Superior in combat.
          Agent- a super-spy. Deadly in combat.
     
          Recruiters- find people to join your cause of capital gain.

          And then there are the people associated with money...
          Pimp- in charge of the local pro organizations.
          Dealer- in charge of the local drug rings.
          
          Every location has a 'D&S' demand. This determines the success 
     one might have by deploying pimps and dealers in certain areas. 
     These men usually make a lot of money for a gang; more than enough 
     to cover their own salaries.


          INCOME

          Your income comes from the following:
          Locations you control (from terrorizing the locals)
          Organizations you control.
          Pimps deployed in areas of demand.
          Dealers deployed in areas of demand.
          Donations from other gangs.
