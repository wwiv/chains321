Conspiracy- Version 1.0

    Welcome to the 80's. Gang warfare is at its worst! It used to be easy.
With no competition, we could make a lot of money. Occasionally, the police
intervened, but they never got the big guys- just the underlings. Everyone
was happy, working together. But then, something terrible happened. Other
gangs arose. And then, there was no more monopoly. Your goal- reestablish
this monopoly.


Installation of Conspiracy is simple...
1) Compile Conspire.pas and Consinit.pas
2) Copy Conspire.com into your main BBS directory.
3) Copy Consinit.com into your main BBS directory.
4) Copy Conshelp.txt into your Gfiles directory (for text files.)
5) Run Consinit.com while in your main BBS directory.

If you want to register, send $2 to the address below. If you don't,
that's fine. But hey- for $2, you can sleep well, right?

You are free to modify the source, but please don't distribute your
mods. If you have a good one, send it to me and it will be put in.

In the next version, there are 2 hopeful additions; they are:
1- FBI as a balancing factor- based on Public opinion.
2- Assassinations
