Hello. Included in the StarClash archive are:

Starclas.pas - source to starclash
Starinit.pas - initializes data files for starclash
Stardocs.txt - general instructions and rules for StarClash
Sysop400.txt - info on StarClash for SysOps.
Regis.dat    - registration info on SC. DO NO CHANGE!

There are three steps to setting up StarClash.
1) Copy Starclas.com into you main BBS directory.
2) Run starinit.com (while in your BBS directory).
3) Install in your BBS list of chains.

You can do more if you want. Some ideas include:
4) Putting the StarDocs.txt in gfiles. This makes online help available.
5) you can modify Starinit.pas. This will change different values for the
   game.
