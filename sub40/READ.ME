Message from Filo:

Since many sysops do not have a pascal compiler readily available,
I have taken the liberty of compiling this game for you.  The
pascal source code is included unchanged from that of the author.
If you like having the game compiled for you, send me a little
note of appreciation (1 @5252); if you like the game, send the
author a note also.
